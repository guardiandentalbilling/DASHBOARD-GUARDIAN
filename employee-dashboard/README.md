## 📡 **Complete API System**

### **Employee Management**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/employees` | Get all employees with filtering |
| GET | `/api/employees/:id` | Get employee by ID |
| POST | `/api/employees` | Create new employee |
| PUT | `/api/employees/:id` | Update employee details |
| DELETE | `/api/employees/:id` | Delete employee |
| GET | `/api/employees/search?q=term` | Search employees |

## Role-Based Access (RBAC)
Include `js/auth-guard.js` on every protected page. For admin-only pages add:
`<meta name="require-role" content="admin">` or `data-require-role="admin"` on the body. Elements that should be visible only to admins can use the attribute `data-admin-only` and they will be hidden for employees.

The guard expects `localStorage` entries created at login:
```
authToken: JWT token
userData: { id, name, email, role }
```
If missing or invalid the user is redirected to `login.html`.

## Time Tracking API
Base path: `/api/time-tracking`

Endpoints (all require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and role employee or admin):
POST `/start` – begin a new session (prevents overlapping)
POST `/pause` – pauses active session (records break start)
POST `/resume` – resumes last paused session
POST `/stop` – stops active session and persists totalElapsed (ms)
GET `/sessions?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD` – list sessions in range (defaults limited to 500)
GET `/summary/:workDay?` – daily aggregate; if `:workDay` omitted current day is used
POST `/activity` – add an activity note to active session `{ note: string }`

Model: `TimeLog`
```
employeeId (User ref)
workDay (YYYY-MM-DD)
taskDescription
startTime / endTime
totalElapsed (ms)
isActive
breaks [{ pauseTime, resumeTime }]
activities [{ ts, note }]
```

Client Integration: `time-tracking-service.js` was updated to send start/stop events to the backend when a token exists. LocalStorage remains as an offline/demo fallback. The profile time tracker and any other UI relying on the service benefit automatically.

## Migration / Notes
- Existing Attendance remains unchanged; TimeLog adds granular sessions.
- When DB is not connected server falls back to demo mode and generic handlers; time tracking then only persists locally.

### **Attendance System**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/attendance/checkin` | Employee check-in |
| PUT | `/api/attendance/checkout` | Employee check-out |
| GET | `/api/attendance/status/:employeeId` | Current attendance status |
| GET | `/api/attendance/history/:employeeId` | Attendance history |
| GET | `/api/attendance/analytics` | Admin attendance analytics |

### **Loan Management**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/loan-requests` | Create loan request |
| GET | `/api/loan-requests` | Get all loan requests (admin) |
| PUT | `/api/loan-requests/:id/status` | Approve/reject loan |
| POST | `/api/loan-requests/:id/payment` | Add payment |
| GET | `/api/loan-requests/analytics` | Loan analytics |
