# 🔐 Role-Based Authentication System

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!**

Your Employee Dashboard now has **complete role-based authentication** with separate access levels for admins and employees.

---

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Login Flow:**
1. **All users start at:** `/login.html`
2. **Enter credentials** (email + password)
3. **System checks role** and redirects accordingly:
   - **Admin** → `/admin.html` (Full admin dashboard)
   - **Employee** → `/index.html` (Employee-only dashboard)

### **Access Control:**
- **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin.html`)
  - ✅ Only admins can access
  - ✅ Employees are redirected to employee dashboard
  - ✅ Contains employee management, reports, settings
  
- **Employee Dashboard** (`/index.html`)
  - ✅ Employees and admins can access
  - ✅ Contains daily work tools and features
  - ✅ Shows role indicator (Admin/Employee)

## 👥 **User Roles & Permissions**

### **Employee:**
